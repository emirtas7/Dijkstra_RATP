## Compilation flags

The command for compilation was following the indicated guidelines (use of flags...)

Also the environment used in this project was Visual Studio Code.

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -pedantic-errors -O3 My_station_parser.cpp main.cpp -o main.exe
```



## PART 1 
#### __'Grade' problem__

When compiling including the 'object' file Grade 2019:


```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -pedantic-errors -O3 My_station_parser.cpp main.cpp "Grade 2019 clang-1001.0.46.3 MACOSX.o" -o main.exe
```
There is a problem that arises that cannot be solved :
```bash
(base) emir@MacBook-Air-de-Emir Resources-20230329 % g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -pedantic-errors -O3 My_station_parser.cpp main.cpp "Grade 2019 clang-1001.0.46.3 MACOSX.o" -o main.exe
